This folder contains all the software programs (arduino, python) to run the QKD kit.

If you wish to compile and upload the code to your own arduino, the arduino libraries in the folder "Arduino_Libraries" should be placed under "
\<parent\>/\<directories\>/Arduino/libraries" so that the import commands work properly.
